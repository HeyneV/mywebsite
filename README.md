GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them  

1. I added my name, photo, links to my work and contact information - phone number, email and links to my Github, LinkedIN and Twitter pages.
____________________

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

1. When you click on the navaigation buttons at the top of the page it takes you to the corresponding links in body of the webpage.
____________________

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

1. I tried and tried to get this to work and even asked for help. But could not get it to work. 

___________________

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others


1. When you click on the link - email, LinkedIN, etc. The image displays bigger.
__________________

WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application

1. The links to Github, email, LinkedIn, Twitter, and resume take you to those applications

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

1. I could get this to work partially, but not the entire page to react. I am not for sure why. Again I asked for help and thought I could get it to work.

***** I know I definitely need more practice in creating my own webpage. Some of the frustration for me is that there are so many different ways to do things. I think I need do more research on which HTML coding works the best for what I am doing.
